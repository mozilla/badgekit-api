# Issuing

Issuing is the process of awarding a badge to a specific earner. In BadgeKit API, issuing a badge means creating a badge instance. __Note that when a review is submitted in which an earner application for a badge is approved, this does not mean that the badge is automatically issued. Issuer sites must use the below API endpoints to issue badges, marking any relevant applications as processed when this occurs. These endpoints also apply to badges issued without the assessment process, for example badges issued directly to earner email addresses or using claim codes.__

## Badge Instances

| NAME | VALUE |
|:---|:---|
| `slug` | __string__ |
| `email` | __email address__ - _earner email_ |
| `expires` | __timestamp__ - _optional expiry date_ |
| `issuedOn` | __timestamp__ - _API will generate_ |
| `claimCode` | [claim code](claim-codes.md) - _if badge is issued using claim code_ |
| `assertionUrl` | __url__ - _location of issued badge assertion, generated by API_ |
| `badge` | [badge](badges.md) - _API endpoints return badge issued along with instances_ |

## Create a Badge Instance

To actually issue (or "award") a badge to an earner in BadgeKit API, you create a badge instance. A badge instance is an awarded badge, issued to a specific earner.

### Expected request

```
POST /systems/:slug/badges/:slug/instances
POST /systems/:slug/issuers/:slug/badges/:slug/instances
POST /systems/:slug/issuers/:slug/programs/:slug/badges/:slug/instances
```

Requests can be sent as `application/json`, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`.

| Parameters             | Required        | Description              |
|:-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **email** | required | The email address for the earner the badge is being issued to. |
| **claimCode** | optional | A claim code for the badge. |
| **slug** | optional | Instance slug. (API will generate if not provided.) |
| **issuedOn** | optional | Timestamp representing date issued. (API will generate if not provided.) |
| **expires** | optional | Timestamp representing date instance expires. |

### Expected response

```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "status": "created",
  "instance": {
      "slug": "abcdefghi123456789abcdefghi123456789",
      "email": "earner@somedomain.com",
      "expires": null,
      "issuedOn": "2014-05-29T10:16:01.654Z",
      "claimCode": "abcde12345",
      "assertionUrl": "http://issuersite.com/public/assertions/abcdefghi123456789abcdefghi123456789",
      "badge": null
  }
}
```

The assertion URL represents the location of the badge assertion. A badge assertion contains the details of an issued badge. See the latest [assertion](https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges-specification/blob/master/Assertion/latest.md) specification for more information. Claim code is only returned if the badge instance was created using a claim code.

* instance
 * slug
 * email
 * expires
 * issuedOn
 * claimCode
 * assertionUrl
 * [badge](badges.md)
